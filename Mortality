S = Proportional survival
          S = e^-Zt,        where t is time
          
A = Proportional mortality
          A = 1-e^-Zt       where t is time

Z = instantaneous total mortality 
          Z = M + F
          
M = Instantaneous natural mortality
F = Instantaneous fishing mortatlity






S = 1 - A
A = 1 - S
