I’m interested in fisheries science with a specific focus on early life history variation, phenotypic diversity, and recruitment dynamics.


I’m currently learning and working in...

	Agent-based modeling:						Interactive Data Language (IDL) and NetLogo
	
	Population and statistical modeling:		R and Python
		

I’m always open to new challenges and collaborations with other motivated aquatic ecologist.
